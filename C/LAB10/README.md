This was an interesting lab so I'm putting it here for posterity. Basically just some benchmark tests done for matrices and other stuff.

Compile:

    gcc -O3 -o (whatever) (c file)

For ex3:

    gcc -m32 -O2 -o mountain *.c


Specifically for ex1 you can run it as:

    ./ex1 partb

To see different loop orderings and how they affect performance. Interesting stuff!
