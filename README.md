# Summary
This is just a small repository for homeworks and maybe labs for the course. Since I switch between my Windows and Linux partitions fairly often when developing, keeping a Git repo is a good way for me to keep changes conistent across platforms (including other systems if the need arises). Additionally, that means you can look through my code and (hopefully) see some improvement as I go through the course.
